Python basic data types -
int, float, bool , none
Conditional Statemtns
if , while
Releation opertions
> <
Strings
Collections --  Group of objects
lists,set,tuple,dict

Python --- python 3.7 ( Future of the language)
python 2 will not work on python 3

REPL - >read , evaluates, print, loop
Pycharm -IDE -- to write
10 base 10
0b101 // base to 2 represenstiona of numeric 5

interger in python can be represented with a base
0b101 // numeric

opertaions on numerics
conversion of other data type into numeric
Every thing is object in python -- even basic data types
But this is not true for Java or C++
10  it is not an object  -- java

Classes - oop

Basic or Scalar -- Single value
int
float
bool
none

Collections
 Str
 List
 Tupe
 Dict

 int -- represnation , base represnation
operations , +, -, **
Converions

intereg presenstion using underscore 10_000_000


Float
3.9 10^6

opertaions
converstions of ther types

bool
--- Several liabrries uses bool ..
Creation - True, False  -Casesensite
Operation -- Logical operators
Converstion -- Pay attention  -- it widely used in if and while conditional statemetns
Bool of Zero,empty,None, empty collection is always False


None is equilvante null or null obect
None is an empty object -- functions , lambdas .. this will be helpful
-- operations or conversion

Condition statem -if , if else , elif
if ,elif,else

while loop
 -- break
  -- Continue
 if expr:
     print('This is true')

	 expr - bool()

while expr:
		print('statements')
	until expr become false ... This gets executed
	contineu
	break
	continue wont break the loop but jumps control to the starting of the loop
//Reading input from standard console
you can use input function
return type of input is string

String in python -- String maniuplation is core to python
--- creating string
 -- operations
 -- Converting string to other

 Collection
 -str
 - list
 -tuple
 - set
 -dict

 String is a sequnce of unicode charchters in python
ascii
utf-8, uft-32
escape sequcne --- \
Multi line string
raw strings doesnt care about escape charchters
path='c:\users\home'

Creation
operation

Strings are immutable in python  - if you do any operation on a string a new string is created. existing string cannot be changed

str -- object
'a'*5 --- repetation

2*5

if an object doesnt have any reference it is eligibel for garbage collection
a='abc'

a='ABC'

essetily small abc is eligible for garbage collection

Immutable
String,
Tupes

Mutable
list
dict
set
custom
